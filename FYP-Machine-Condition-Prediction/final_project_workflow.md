### 01. Influx DB (Real time data coming in 10-second intervals)

### 02. Get every data point via GET Method

### 03. Collect 360 data points

### 04. Calculate the average (Mean) value of all features for the past hour

### 05. Store/ Save the new average (Mean) value as a new entry in Mongo DB via POST Method

### 06. Retrieve the last Lookback from the Mongo DB via GET Method

### 07. Model Inference:
```
	- Data Preprocessing Pipeline
	- Feed the preprocessed data into the Model
	- Get the Model Output
	- Apply Tolerance Band Logic
```

### 08. Define Anomaly Detection - Percentage in which the model output horizon points are exceeding the healthy boundary

### 09. If the Anomaly Score Percentage >= 30%? Machine Condition at Risk: Machine Condition Normal

### 10. If Machine Condition at Risk? (Machine Condition at Risk) Return a Generated Alert + Email: (Machine Condition Normal) Return a Generated Alert

### 11. Dockerize the Application

### 12. Test with Autogenerated Fake Data in Influx DB
